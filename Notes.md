How to build a CLI Gem:

	1. Plan your gem, imagine your interface
	A command line interface for art exhibitions, starting with:
	
	-User types "art-exhibitions"
	
	-Show a list of exhibitions
	
		a. Exhibition title - where - available until date
		b. [â€¦]
	
	- Which exhibition do you want to learn more about?



	2. Start with the project structure - google
		Google how to build a gem? https://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/
		Make a gem using Bundle http://railscasts.com/episodes/245-new-gem-with-bundler
		How build a cli gem. Research about patterns to create gems


	3. Start with the entry point - the file run.
		a. The executable, that into the bin. Because is not a Ruby file I need to put: #!/usr/bin/env ruby
	
		
	4. Force that to build the CLI interface
		a. Build the logic inside the cli.rb, the cli controller. Even with harcoded data
	5. Stub out the interface
